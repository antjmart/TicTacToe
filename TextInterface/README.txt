TIC-TAC-TOE Game on a Text-Based Interface

This is a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game, programmed in Python, that functions on a socket connection.
Remote connections between devices cannot be made with the programmed sockets in this project, but two connections (on two separate windows) can be made on a device in order to play Tic-Tac-Toe. 
The game is played with text based inputs only.
