TIC-TAC-TOE Game on a Graphical User Interface

This is a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game, programmed in Python, that functions on a socket connection.
Remote connections between devices cannot be made with the programmed sockets in this project, but two connections (on two separate windows) can be made on a device in order to play Tic-Tac-Toe. 
The game is played by interacting with the GUIs that pop up. The Tkinter library was used to achieve this.
